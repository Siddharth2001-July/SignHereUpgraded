# Sign Here Widget

The Sign Here Widget POC is a proof of concept designed to enhance the user experience in digital document signing processes. This project introduces a widget that visually guides users to signature fields within a document. It not only highlights where signatures are required but also facilitates navigation, automatically moving the user to the next signature field. This intuitive approach aims to streamline the signing process, making it more efficient and user-friendly.

## Features

- **Visual Guidance:** A widget is displayed alongside signature fields, indicating where users need to sign.
- **Automatic Navigation:** Users are automatically taken to the next signature field after completing one, simplifying the process.
- **Easy to Use:** Designed with user experience in mind, the widget makes the digital signing process straightforward and efficient.
